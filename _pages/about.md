I'm currently a last year undergraduate student of computer engineering at Sharif University of Technology(which is the best university in Iran according to [QS world ranking 2023](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023)).
My research interests include:
- Machine Learning and Deep learning
- Multi-Modal Deep neural networks
- Spurious Correlations and Robustness in Machine learning

I'm very passionate about developing deep learning models which can be robust to different correlations and noises, so they can be used by people in their daily life.
Currently I'm doing research in [L3S research institute](https://www.l3s.de/) (working on multi-modal deep neural networks) under the supervision of [Prof. Prasenjit Mitra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8PbgiPkAAAAJ&hl=en).
