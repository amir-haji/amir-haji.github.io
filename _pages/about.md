I'm currently a last year undergraduate student of computer engineering at Sharif University of Technology(which is the best university in Iran according to [QS world ranking 2023](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2023)).
My research interests include:
- Machine Learning for healthcare
- Multi-Modal learning
- Robust and Fair Machine Learning

I'm passionate about developing robust multi-modal learning models robust against noises and correlations in data. I previously completed my research internship in [L3S research institute](https://www.l3s.de/) (working on multi-modal models for clinical prediciton) under the supervision of [Prof. Prasenjit Mitra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8PbgiPkAAAAJ&hl=en). Currently, I'm working on my bachelor's degree project focusing on bias mitigation in in deep learning.
